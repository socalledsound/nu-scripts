should I talk about the jsx transform in React 17 - ie the reason we don't need to import React?
hold off on discussing this for now

-- i think this could happen in virtual DOM video


 and then be followed up on in i heart react


MODALS in week 3

02 JS : ternary operator from old course? add css related examples? conditionals w ternary?

10 JS spread syntax (minae script?  add useState?)

do we want to use yup or regex?

(should we have video on modals?  custom hook?  could also be week 5 thing to do)
this was before : CODE CHALLENGE: MODAL
where to put it?
could also do a thing with buttons, that was previously planned
useFormik hook


week4 useReducer useContext


week 5 async content
rewrite any of those 1-7?
carousel
custom hooks?
