## video 19 : file structure

    create the folders we'll eventually need:
        --app - 'shared' folder.  show them the data right off the bat.
            -- maybe a whole video talking about data flow somewhere????
        --assets (can we import images as files into our app instead of pulling them in as URLs?)
            -- maybe a video on importing images into react somewhere?
        --components
        --features
        --pages
        --utils
        -- we won't have anything in them yet.
