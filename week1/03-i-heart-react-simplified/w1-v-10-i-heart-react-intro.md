I HEART REACT

[VO]
Hello and welcome back!

And guess what? Reactors, it's time to start Reacting.

In this section of the course, you're going to build your first React App.

And it's going to look like this. Pretty simple, but I hope also just a little bit fun. You can see that there are a bunch of hearts and each one has a text.

These messages are kind of like the uncanny valley of candy heart messages. They were generated by an AI, that was trained on a collection of real candy heart messages. You can read all about the process at the link down below if you're interested.

Remember Array.map()?

We're going to use an array containing those messages as our data,

I hope it will be fun and will be a nice, easy intro to the basics of working with React.

So let's get started. I'll see you in the next one, where we'll use a command line tool called create-react-app to do just that -- create our react app.
