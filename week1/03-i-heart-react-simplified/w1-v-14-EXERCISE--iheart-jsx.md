Welcome Back. In the last video we talked about components, and how theyre the basic building blocks of React applications.  In this video, we're going to write one of our own.

[SC]

[VO]
It's going to be a Heart Component, and it's going to generate the Heart that you see on the screen now.

[SC]
animating many hearts being generated
[VO]
And, as I said in the intro to this section, we're ultimately going to use that component to render a bunch of hearts to the page, one for each message of artificially intelligent love.

[SC]
scrolling down the page

[VO]
But before we start writing our new Heart component, I want you to first, scroll just a little down the exercise page and notice that there are links to two files that I want you to add to this project.

[SC]

[VO]
The first is an svg file, which is a red heart.

[SC]
downloading heart svg
[VO]
Download that file and

[SC]
copying into src folder
[VO]
then, copy it in to the src folder.

The second is a css file named App.css a css file there.

[SC]
show replacing the App.css file
[VO]
Download that file, and then replace the App.css that is currently in the src folder with that file, which is also called App.css.
[SC]

[SC]

[VO]
If you need to, go ahead and pause the video here while you manage those downloads. I'll be here whejn you're ready to continue.

[SC]
show file browser
[VO]
Now, if you got those files in the right places, your file browser should look something like this.

[SC]
show this code in vs code:
.App-header {
background-color: #744b78;
min-height: 20vh;
display: flex;
flex-direction: column;
align-items: center;
justify-content: center;
font-size: 3rem;
color: white;
}

    .hearts-container {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    }

    .heart {
    width: 10rem;
    margin: 2rem;
    }

    .heart-img {
    width: 15rem;
    }

    .heart-message {
    position: relative;
    width: 8rem;
    top: -9rem;
    left: 1.5rem;
    color: black;
    font-size: 1.5rem;
    text-align: center;
    }

[VO]

And you should be able to click on the App.css file and see something like this. Looking at the classes there, you can see that we'll have a number of class names that we will use to style our components -- there's some sizing and positioing for the elements of the Heart and then a flexbox container to hold all of the hearts.

[SC]

going to App.js

[VO]
Ok so let's head over to our App.js now.

[SC]
deleting App return statement.
function App() {
return (

        )
    }
    export default App

[VO]
First, I want you to delete everything inside the return statement for the App component.

[VO]

[SC]

    function App() {
        return (

        )
    }
    export default App

[VO]

So when you're done deleting, it should look like this.

[SC]

[VO]

[SC]

    const message = 'cool cud'

    function App {
        return (

        )
    }
    export default App

[VO]
Next, up above our App component, write a javascript variable.

It'll be a constant named message and we'll set it equal to a string, one of our the messages that were generated by that AI. 'cool cud'. Which is very flirty, and making me blush a little but I'll try to focus.

[SC]
focus on
return (

        )

[VO]
Now, we're ready for a little JSX. Remember, the JSX goes in the return statement, between the parentheses.

[SC]
focus on
return (

<div>{message}</div>
)

[VO]

Let's start with a div, with opening and closing tags. Between the tags, write some curly braces, and inside those curly braces,the word message. Remember, if we want to use javascript, we need to write the curly braces -- without them, the compiler will think that we want to display the word 'message'.

Go ahead and save this file.

[SC]

[VO]
Now if your app isn't currently being served, let's start that up so we can see what we've done.

[SC]
show key command
[VO]

And again, to do that you'll first, open up your vs code terminal -- which you can toggle open by using the ctrl key together with the backtick character on the top left of your keyboard.

[SC]

[VO]
If your dev server is already running, from the last exercise, then you'll see a message like this in the terminal.

[SC]

running command

[VO]
If not, you can go ahead and run the command npm start to start it up,

[SC]

[VO]

and it should build your site and then eventually show a message that let's you know that it is serving the site in the browser.

[SC]

[VO]
If for some reason it doesn't...you should probably stop and watch the video in the troubleshooting section on live server issues, and if that doesn't answer your question, immediately ask your instructor for help! It's no fun to get stuck on installation issues.

[SC]
show browser
[VO]
If it did succeed, then just head over to the browser and see what it says. It should say......'cool cud'.

Which is great! And very sweet.

[SC]

[VO]
But what we want to do is, take this message, and display it inside of that heart logo, right? And we're going to use a custom component to do it.

[SC]

    <Heart msg={message} >

[VO]

So back in the return statement of our App.js, let's turn that div into own custom component, called Heart, which we have written yet. And, instead of simply rendering the message, let's pass that message in to our Heart, as a prop.

Do you remember props? Props are the arguments that we can pass in to a react component. When we write a prop, it's added as a key to an object named props that is available as an input parameter in our React components.

[SC]
const Heart = (props) => {

    }

[VO]

Now, up above our App component, let's write that Heart component as a stateless functional component . And remember to bring in the props, so it will have a single input parameter, named props.

[SC]

    const Heart = (props) => {
        return (
            <div 'heart'>
                 <img className='heart-img' src={logo} alt='heart' />
                <p className='heart-message'>{props.msg}</p>
            </div>
        )
    }

[VO]
Next, let's define the return expression. It's going to have a div with a classname of heart and that div will have a few children.

First, an img tag. Which we will give a className of 'heart-img'. And we'll set the src to be a variable named HeartLogo and then we'll set the alt to be 'heart'.

Then, we'll add a p tag with a className 'heart-message' and inside the tags we'll display the message by writing first the curly bracesgive that a value of props.msg.

[SC]

    const Heart = (props) => {
        return (
            <div 'heart'>
                 <img className='heart-img' src={logo} alt='heart' />
                <p className='heart-message'>{props.msg}</p>
            </div>
        )
    }

[VO]
So our component should look something like this. And, if you save this file and look in the browser, you should see the message, along with...a react logo. Which isn't what we want.

We need to replace that react logo with a heart.

[SC]
import HeartLogo from './ heart.svg'
[VO]
So let's get rid of that logo import and instead import that a HeartLogo, which we will be the name that we give that svg when we import it..

[SC]

        const Heart = (props) => {
        return (

        <div className='heart'>
        <img className='heart-img' src={HeartLogo} alt='heart' />
        <p className='heart-message'>{props.msg}</p>
        </div>
        )
        }

[VO]
And finally, modify the src prop of your the img tag inside your Heart component so that it uses the new variable.

[SC]
show heart
[VO]
If you save this and look at your web browser, you should see the message, rendered inside a heart!

[SC]

    const App = () => {
    return (
        <Header />
        <Heart msg={message}/>
    )
    }

[VO]
And now, I've got a challenge for you. Can you write another component, on your own? It will be called Header and I want you to render it just above our Heart.

[SC]

    const App = () => {
        return (
            <>
                <Header />
                <HeartMessage msg={message}/>
            </>
        )
    }

[VO]
But, remember, components have to return just one element.

So we can indent these two components one level and wrap them in an empty div.

Or, even better, we can just use an empty element, which in React is called a Fragment. Fragments are great because they create minimal overhead for the virtual DOM.

So now, we're bundling together two components and returning a single Fragment that contains both of them.

[SC]
I ❤️ React
[VO]

In your Header component I want you to return a single div with the text 'I ❤️ React'. You can copy the emoji from the exercise page, or if you prefer you can just use the word 'Heart' instead.

[SC]

 <div className='App-header' >I ❤️ React</div>
[VO]
Finally, I want you to give the div in your header a class name of 'App-header' -- which, by the way, is a class that is specified in the App.css file.

[SC]
show the Header above the heart

[VO]

So your page should end up looking something like this.

Got it? Ok. Remember, all you need to do is, write a new stateless functional component named Header, on the page above the App component, which will display the text that I specified. Now get to work and I'll see you in the next video when you're done with that Header component!

Don't take too much time with it, if it's not doing quite what you want, just join me in the next video, where I'll write it and also talk a bit more about composing websites using components. I'll see you there.
