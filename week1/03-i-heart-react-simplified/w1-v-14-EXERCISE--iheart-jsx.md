# NEED THE INTRO TEXT, WILL DEPEND ON WHERE THIS IS, OR WHETHER JSX IS INTRODUCED EARLIER

[SC]

[VO]

Welcome Back. In the last exercise, we took a tour of the stub App that create react app installs for us.

[SC]

[VO]
In this exercise, we're going to use JSX to create something like what you see on the page now. It's going to be a your first component,

[SC]
animating many hearts being generated
[VO]
And, as I said in the intro to this section, we're ultimately going to use that component to render a bunch of hearts to the page, one for each message of artificially intelligent love.

[SC]
show deleting the code in the App.css file
[VO]
So, before we write our new Heart component, let's start by modifying the css file for our App, which is in App.css.

I want you to delete everything in it and replace it with some css classes that you can find on the page below, which we'll use to style our app.

[SC]
show this code in vs code:
.App-header {
background-color: #744b78;
min-height: 20vh;
display: flex;
flex-direction: column;
align-items: center;
justify-content: center;
font-size: 3rem;
color: white;
}

    .hearts-container {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    }

    .heart {
    width: 10rem;
    margin: 2rem;
    }

    .heart-img {
    width: 15rem;
    }

    .heart-message {
    position: relative;
    width: 8rem;
    top: -9rem;
    left: 1.5rem;
    color: black;
    font-size: 1.5rem;
    text-align: center;
    }

[VO]

Looking at them, you can see that we'll have a number of class names that we can use in our JSX.

I'm not going to talk about them too much, so we can get to work on the React side of things.

But you can see that there's a class name for a header, and another for a flex box container for all of the hearts, and then individual classes to style a heart image, heart message and then a container for the heart message and heart image which will simply be called a heart.

[SC]
show the place on the page where the css code is
[VO]

So what I want you to do is, copy that code from down here.......and then paste it in to replace what's currently in your App.css file.

[SC]
show the download link
[VO]
Or, you can simply download the file from down here

[SC]
downloading and replacing the file
[VO]
and replace the file that's in the src folder with the file that you just downloaded.

You might need to pause the video while you do that.

Go ahead and pause the video here if you need a little time to do that.

[SC]
deleting App return statement.
function App() {
return (

        )
    }
    export default App

[VO]
Now, I want you to delete everything inside the return statement for the App component.

[VO]

[SC]

    function App() {
        return (

        )
    }
    export default App


    const App = () => {
        return (

        )
    }

[VO]

So when you're done deleting, it should look like this.

[SC]

[VO]

[SC]

    const message = 'cool cud'

    function App {
        return (

        )
    }
    export default App

[VO]
Up above our App component, let's also write a javascript variable. It'll be a constant named message and we'll set it equal to a string, one of our the messages of love that were generated by an AI. 'Cool cud'. So sweet! I'm swooning just a little.

[SC]
focus on
return (

        )

[VO]
Now, we're ready for a little JSX. Remember, the JSX goes in the return statement, between the parentheses.

[SC]
focus on
return (

<div>message</div>
)

[VO]

Let's start with a div, with opening and closing tags. Between the tags, write the word message.

Go ahead and save this file.

[SC]

[VO]
Now if your app isn't currently being served, let's start that up so we can see what we've done.

And again, to do that you'll first, open up your vs code terminal -- which you can do either up above from the file menu, like this.....

Or using the ctrl key along with the backtick character.

Now, in the terminal, you can see which directory you're currently in. This is important! With any luck, you're currently in the root directory of your app.

If you're not sure you can double check by

type yarn start to start it up.

[SC]
show browser
[VO]
Now, go over to your browser and see what it say. I'll pause here for a second while you go and do that. It should say......'message'.

Is that what you expected it to say?

Did you expect it to say 'cool cud'?

If you think back to what you learned in the last video, I bet you can fix it so that it uses the javascript variable that we just wrote.

But before you do, I want you to notice something in the terminal.

[SC]
Compiled with warnings.

src/App.js
Line 4:7: 'message' is assigned a value but never used no-unused-vars
[VO]

Here we can see React's great build tools helpfully warning us that we are not writing very good code here. We've initialized a variable, but we're not using it anywhere. It's not a problem that breaks our site -- the browser faithfully displays our work -- but it is still not good code. Generally, we want to always make sure that we clear up any warnings liks this one before we continue.

[SC]
show the yellow squiggles
[VO]
And vs code is, actually, giving us the same warning, with those yellow squiggles under our message variable.

[SC]

show the div with the message word

[VO]
And the reason that we're getting these warnings is, of course that we aren't using the message variable.

In our JSX, if we forget the curly braces, then the interpreter thinks we simply want to include the text 'message' as the inner text of our div.

[SC]

focus on
return (

<div>{message}</div>
)

[VO]

So we can enclose the message text with curly braces, and immediately see that vs code has gotten rid of the yellow squiggles and if you save it again,

[SC]
switching to browser
[VO]
and look in the browser, you should see the 'cool cud' text in the browser. And now, that warning is also gone from the terminal.

[SC]
<Heart msg={message} >
[VO]

Let's break it again, by switch our div to use our own custom component, called Heart, which we have written yet. And, instead of siomply rendering the message, let's pass it in, as a prop.

Do you remember props? Props are the arguments that we can pass in to a react component. When we write a prop, it is added as a key to an object named props that is available as an input parameter in our React components.

[SC]
const Heart = (props) => {

    }

[VO]

So let's write that Heart component now, and bring in the props.

Up above the App component, let's make another stateless functional component, called Heart, and it will have a single input parameter, named props.

You can see that those squiggles are back, because I've defined a function but I'm not using it anywhere. We'll use it very soon.

[SC]

    const Heart = (props) => {
        return (
            <div 'heart'>
                 <img className='heart-img' src={logo} alt='heart' />
                <p className='heart-message'>{props.msg}</p>
            </div>
        )
    }

[VO]
But first, let's define a return expression. It's going to have a div with a classname of heart that will have a few children.

First, an img tag. We'll give at a className of 'heart-img', set the src to be a variable named HeartLogo and then we'll set the alt prop to 'heart'.

Then, we'll add a p tag with a className 'heart-message' and inside the tags we'll display the message by writing first the curly bracesgive that a value of props.msg.

    const Heart = (props) => {
        return (
            <div 'heart'>
                 <img className='heart-img' src={logo} alt='heart' />
                <p className='heart-message'>{props.msg}</p>
            </div>
        )
    }

So our component should look something like this. And, if you save this file and look in the browser, you should see the message, along with...a react logo. Which isn't what we want.

We need to replace that react logo with a heart.

[SC]
downloading heart svg
[VO]
You should be able to find a heart svg at the bottom of this page. download it now.

[SC]
copying into src folder
[VO]
Then, copy it in to the src folder.

[SC]
import HeartLogo from 'heart.svg'
[VO]
Next, replace the import statement at the top of the page so that you import the heart svg

[SC]
const Heart = (props) => {
return (

<div className='heart'>
<img className='heart-img' src={HeartLogo} alt='heart' />
<p className='heart-message'>{props.msg}</p>
</div>
)
}
[VO]
And finally, modify the src prop of your the img tag inside your Heart component so that it uses the new variable.

[SC]
show heart
[VO]
If you save this and look at your web browser, you should see the message, rendered inside a heart!

[SC]

    const App = () => {
    return (
        <Header />
        <Heart msg={message}/>
    )
    }

[VO]
And now, I've got a challenge for you. Can you write another component, on your own? It will be called Header and I want you to render it just above our HeartMessage.

[SC]

    const App = () => {
        return (
            <>
                <Header />
                <HeartMessage msg={message}/>
            </>
        )
    }

[VO]
But, remember, components have to return just one element. So we can indent these two components one level and wrap them in an empty div. Or, even better, we can just use an empty element, which in React is called a Fragment. Fragments are great because they create minimal overhead for the virtual DOM.

So now, we're bundling together two components and returning a single Fragment that contains both of them.

[SC]
I ❤️ React
[VO]

In your Header component I want you to return a single div with the text 'I ❤️ React'. You can copy the emoji from this page, or if you prefer you can just use the word 'Heart' instead.

[SC]

 <div className='App-header' >I ❤️ React</div>
[VO]
Finally, I want you to give the div in your header a class name of 'App-header' -- which, by the way, is a class that is specified in the App.css file.

[SC]
show the Header above the heart

[VO]

So your page should end up looking something like this.

Got it? Ok. Get to work and I'll see you in the next video when you're done with that Header component. Don't take too much time with it, if it's not doing quite what you want, just join me in the next video, where I'll write it and also talk about some of the ways we can style a React component. I'll see you there.
