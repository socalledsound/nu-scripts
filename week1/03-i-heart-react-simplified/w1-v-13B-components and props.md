    <App>
        <MyHeader>
        <AComponent>
        <AnotherComponent>

At their most basic level, React components are ways of bundling together React elements. We use them to declaratively compose user interfaces, and organize chunks of our user interface.

[SC]

        const Header = () => {

        return (

                <header className="App-header">
                <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
                <p>
                Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
                </p>
                <a
                        className="App-link"
                        href="https://reactjs.org"
                        target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >
                Learn React
                </a>
                </header>
            )
            }

[VO]
If I want to, I can take all of the lines that make up the header and put them in their own component. I can put this new function in its own file and import it, but for now I'm just going to write it up above, like this. It's just another arrow function, like the App component and like the App component it also has a name that begins with a capital letter. It's a pretty important style guideline to follow -- always start your React components with capital letters.

I'm calling it Header, and it's going to have a return expression, and in there I'll just paste everything the header element and everything inside of it.

[SC]

    function App = () => {
        return (
            <div>
                <Header />
            </div>
        )
    }

[VO]

Then, I can invoke that function as a React Element, like this. And you can see, no change, I've simply reorganized a little of my code.

[SC]

<div className=''>
[VO]
We're going to get some practice doing this in the next video, but before we go, I want to show you one more thing we can do with JSX. Remember how I was saying that, on a react element, we can set properties like a className or id, or a source for an img tag?

[SC]

    <Component propName={propValue} anotherProp='hi there' className={// DON'T DO THIS ON YOUR COMPONENT PROPS!} />

[VO]

We can also set properties on elements that are generated by our custom components. They're not handled in quite the same way as with DOM elements, so, for instance, though we can use the key 'classname' on our own components, it won't actually set the css classname, and in general it's a good idea to avoid using properties that collide with the DOM API.

[SC]

    <Header text='THIS IS COMING IN AS A PROP'/>

[VO]

But we can set custom properties, and they behave much like function arguments. Here, I'm passing in a prop of text, and setting it to a string.

[SC]

    const Header = (props) => {
    console.log(props)
    return (
        <header className="App-header">
        <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
        <p>
        {props.text}
        </p>
        <p id='hi'></p>

    </header>
    )
    }

[VO]
And now if I add the keyword 'props' to the list of arguments in my Header function, I can
console.log() my props and see that my props are an object that contains a key/value pair equivalent to the prop that I passed in.

[SC]

    <p>{props.text}</p>

[VO]
I can use that value, in my component, like this.

[SC]

    const ChildComponent = (props) => {
        return(
            <div>{props.text}</div>
        )
    }


    const ParentComponent = () => {
        return (
            <ChildComponent text='hi there!'>
        )
    }

[VO]
Props are the key to understanding the flow of data in a React app.

They're a lot like arguments, except that we name the argument when we invoke the component in our JSX.

We can call the prop anything we want, we just have to be sure to remember that whatever we call it when we pass the data in is the key we will use to access that data in the child component.

[SC]
PROPS ARE READ-ONLY
[VO]
Now, there is one very important thing to remember. Props are read only. What does this mean? And why is that a good thing?

[SC]

[VO]
Let's start with what that means.

[SC]
const sum = (a, b) => a + b
[VO]
Remember pure functions? Functions that will always return the same result for a given input?

[SC]
const impureSum = (a, b) => {
const impureA = Math.random() \* a
return impureA + b
}
[VO]
Contrast that function with this version, which is obviously not as predictable and certainly not pure. Here, we have some process inside the function that modifies an input in an unpredictable way, and it makes this function a lot less predictable.

[SC]

[VO]
If you try to modify a prop directly, you'll see that it's not possible. And....keeping in mind what we know about pure and impure functions, I hope you can see now why -- even though it might annoy you sometimes -- that's a really good thing!

And that's most of what you need to know about JSX!

In the next video, we'll get some practice writing components with it. I'll see you there.
