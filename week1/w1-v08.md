#### video 8 ReactDOM - 5 mins?

    (I'd like to ask them to delete everything in the source folder!  and rewrite it from scratch)
    starting with Index.js
    - ReactDOM.render()
    - The virtual DOM
        -- Fiber
        -- reconciliation
        maybe a bit more but not too much

    - also mention that more broadly most node projects, not just React, start at an index.js
