Welcome to your week 1 workshop asignment.

This week you learned a lot about React!   
 
    -- more of a review here?

In workshop, you'll have a chance to put that knowledge into practice.  

Going into workshop, our app is pretty simple -- just a header and a little text. 

During workshop, we're going to start developing our campsites feature.  We're going to add an image gallery -- or actually a campsites gallery -- to our app.
