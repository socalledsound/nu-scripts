Welcome back.

I hope you're as ready as I am to get started on nucampsite, which is the main project that we're going to build in this course....because in this video that's exactly what we're going to do.

vs code editor - screencast showing navigation


##### VO


To get started, what I want you to do is open up vs code and go to the file menu and select open folder.

And we'll navigate to the Desktop and then we'll be in the nucmp folder and once again we'll be in webdev, and then 3-React.  

And that's the folder that we want to open so we'll click open and then we're going to use create-react-app.

So, we'll open up the terminal with terminal -? new terminal or with just ctrl and the backtick key.

And when you've got something like what I've got on the screen here you can just click that open icon and navigate to your desktop and then tthe nucamp folder and we'll be in webdev again and react.

And we'll click open and then we're going to use create-react-app.

And as an aside, typically when we run npx create-react-app we won't give a version, but in this case, since we have a large number of dependencies to install for this site, we want to make sure that all of the versions play happily together, so we'll use that specific version of create react app and it will install a specific version of React for you.

And then we'll call our project nucampsite and then we're going to say --template redux.

And while that runs I'll explain why we're doing that.

We're doing that because we're going to be making a redux application.

And this template redux is going
