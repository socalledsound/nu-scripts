#### video 3b react without react 4: composing with functions -- 7.5 mins? (PRACTICAL)

        this render function is a lot like something you're about to see in React,
            except that in React we get that notion of a virtual DOM, which we'll talk about soon.

[SC]

    const root = document.getElementById('root')
    const div = document.createElement('div')
    div.innerText = 'ðŸ‘‹ hi there'
    div.style.color = 'green'
    div.style.fontSize = '10rem'
    div.style.marginTop = '20vh'
    root.appendChild(div)

[VO]
OK so let's return to our simple javascript app from before, that prints out 'hi there'.
What if we want to say hi to a new user after they log in?

[SC]
const username = 'someone special'

[VO]
The login form is a pretty fundamental requirement for most web apps, and soon we'll learn
how to do this.

But for now, we'll just assign a variable named username with a hard-coded value.

[SC]

    const App = (name) => {
        const div = document.createElement('div')
        div.style.color = 'green'
        div.style.fontSize = '10rem'
        div.style.marginTop = '20vh'
        div.innerText = `ðŸ‘‹ hi there, ${name}`

        return div
    }

[VO]
Then, we'll make something that looks a little bit like a React Component, if you squint. It's going to be a function called App, and it's going to take in a name, and in it we're going to create a div andf then it's going to return that div.

And when we get to React, I want you to remember -- components are functions that always return a single DOM node.

Now, we can just copy our style stuff from before, and our React Components can add inline styling in more or less the same way, as you'll see very soon.

And, in order to use that name value, we're going to call the innerText property of our html element like before, but we're also going to do something just a little bit funky, which is to use something called a template literal, like this.

They're nothing too complicated, but I wanted to mention them here before we get started with React, because you will see them A LOT in React code and the syntax can be a little confusing if you're not familiar with it.

Notice that we have to change our quotation marks to back ticks.

Using string interpolation, as this is called, we can mix a string with javascript primitives by encolsing the javascript in a dollar sign and two curly braces ${}.

As I said, you'll be seeing and using this a lot in this course!

[SC]

    const App = (name) => {
        const div = document.createElement('div')
        div.innerText = `ðŸ‘‹ hi there, ${name}`
        div.style.color = 'green'
        div.style.fontSize = '10rem'
        div.style.marginTop = '20vh'
        return div
    }

    const username = 'chris'
    const root = document.getElementById('root')
    const newDiv = App(username)
    root.appendChild(newDiv)

[VO]
So, now we have an App function, and we can simply invoke that function and pass in our username, to return a div,and then we can append that newDiv to our DOM, just like before.

[SC]
const render = (app, target) => {
target.appendChild(app)
}

[VO]
Now, even though it won't save us any lines of code and won't actually be all that useful, let's also write a render function, like so, that takes in an app and a target, and adds that app to the target node in the DOM.

[SC]

    const render = (app, target) => {
    // do some magical comparing of what is currently in the actual dom
    // to what we have stored in the virtual DOM
    target.appendChild(app)
    }

    render(App(username), document.getElementById('root'))

[VO]

So, we'll first

Like I said, this doesn't actually do much in this code, I just wrote it here to show you where the virtual DOM would be located if we had a virtual DOM. In React, or more specifically, ReactDOM, you will have a render method, and you will pass your app and a target node into it, and in that render function, ReactDOM will do all of the magical diffing that it does to make sure that your app renders properly.

And, I think we're just about ready to do some of that magical diffing now!

Or, I'm ready when you are. In the next video, we'll get started with React!
