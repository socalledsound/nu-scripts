## video 2 - B supercharging your workflow with git -- 10 mins honestly

####

this will be the first of several videos that will deal with git
I don't want to deal with all git stuff here, just th basics
later, we'll get into branching, and remotes
maybe it would be good to also assemble all of the git videos together?

#### FROM OUTLINE:

    but what the heck is git?

    (CODE CHALLENGE ON GIT AND BRANCHES??)
    GIT/GITHUB/BRANCHES/HOW TO USE THESE REPOS
    before we CRA, they download the github repo for the hearts and install it that way,
    run it and see it in action, then ask them to delete it and say that we'll build it from scratch,
    but they can refer to it if they get lost or confused.

    ## the answer to this was an emphatic NO
    (should we also give them the code for the nucamp site somewhere?  this is a big question in my mind
    that I truly don't know the answer too, after 20 years of teaching -- is it better to trust them or not???)
