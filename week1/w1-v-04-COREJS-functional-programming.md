FUNCTIONAL JAVASCRIPT
[VO]

Welcome back.

In the last video, I introduced this idea of functional javascript, and also said that React utilizes functional javasscript.

In fact, I think you could safely say that the wild growth of functional and declarative javascript over the last decade goes hand in hand with the wild and explosive growth of React, the two are inextricably linked.

If you're new to functional javascript, you're in for a treat! It's a powerful and elegant way to write javascript code and it also can be pretty challenging.

But at it's core, it's actually a pretty simple idea: write small and specific functions that can be organized to create larger structures.

IN FUNCTIONAL JAVASCRIPT:

functions should do one thing
functions should be predictable
functions should be self contained

functions should have a return value
functions should avoid side effects

    (*) => React

[VO]
So if the basic organizing block of functional programming is functions, and React is based on functional programming principles, guess what the basic organizing block of React is?

That's right - functions.

[SC]

const newDiv = document.createElement('div')
newDiv.innerText = 'ðŸ‘‹ hi there'
newDiv.style.color = 'green'
newDiv.style.fontSize = '10rem'
newDiv.style.marginTop = '20vh'

[VO]

So to make the code we wrote in the last video more React-like, let's start by turning it into a function.

[SC]
const WelcomeMessage

[VO]

So I'll start by creating a constant that starts with a capital letter, because I'm trying to make this as React-like as possible and in React, by convention, we use capital letters to name our these functions that return DOM nodes, which, again, are called components in React.

[SC]
const WelcomeMessage = (name) => {
const newDiv = document.createElement('div')
newDiv.innerText = 'ðŸ‘‹ hi there'
newDiv.style.color = 'green'
newDiv.style.fontSize = '10rem'
newDiv.style.marginTop = '20vh'
return newDiv
}
[VO]
Now, I'll assign an arrow function that takes in a name. We're going to keep our text from before, and add this name to the text. And then in the body of the function, we can just copy in all of what we wrote before.

And finally, I'll be sure to return that newDiv.

[SC]
const WelcomeMessage = (name) => {
const newDiv = document.createElement('div')
newDiv.innerText = 'ðŸ‘‹ hi there,' + name
newDiv.style.color = 'green'
newDiv.style.fontSize = '10rem'
newDiv.style.marginTop = '20vh'
return newDiv
}
[VO]

Now, to use that name variable, we can just add it to the current name.

[SC]

WelcomeMessage('Chris')

[VO]
Now, when we invoke this function we can pass in any name that we want, and get back a message that's specifically tailored to that person.

[SC]
root.appendChild(WelcomeMessage('Chris'))
[VO]
And if we want this to appear in our DOM, we can just pass in this function invocation, exactly where we passed in the newDiv variable before, because the return value of this function is....our newDiv.

functional programming review

[VO]
So we've a learned a few things about functional programming and about functions in this video, and I just want to review those before we move on.

[SC]
show the list of names in many colors

And guess what? Generating a random color is a great excuse to write a function.
