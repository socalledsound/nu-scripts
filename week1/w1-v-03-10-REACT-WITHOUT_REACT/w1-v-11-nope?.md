Array.map()
[VO]
In the last video, you learned about Array.map().

[SC]
Higher Order Functions
[VO]
You learned that Array.map() is an example of a higher order function.

[SC]

Array.map()
Array.forEach()
Array.filter()
Array.from()
Array.reduce()

[VO]
And you learned that it's one of a number of useful array methods which are higher order functions.
[SC]
declarative programming
[VO]
You also learned that these higher order array methods are an example of declarative programming.

So, instead of writing our own for loop which we can use to iterate over an array, doing something to each element in the array, we let the array method handle the heavy lifting and just tell it how we want the array to be transformed.

This means that our code is less prone to errors and it means we can focus on getting done what we want to get done, leaving the implementation
