## w1 v3 CORE JS - reviewing DOM manipulation -- 7.5 mins?

[SC]
hi there
[VO]
Welcome back. In this first series of videos, we're going to we're going to make the page you see here. It's just a list of names, and of course we could write this in html pretty trivially.

[SC]

It would look like this, actually.

But we're going to do it with javascript, and we're going to write it in a way that is as close as possible to what a React app looks like.

I hope it will be a great introduction to react, and do two several things simultaneously.

[SC]

    Introduce you to how a react app is structured

[VO]

1. introduce you to how React apps are structured, so that when it's time to actually write some React code, it won't be entirely new to you.

    REACT IS JAVASCRIPT

[VO]

2. Show you something that I think is SUPER helpful to remember when you're writing React apps, which is that, for the most part, they're just javascript. React beginners, particularly ones who don't have a long track record with javascript tend to forget that. If you can learn and remember the ways in which React is just javascript, I think you'll be a much more capable and confident React developer. The goal is to make sure that you know all the javascript you need to know.

JAVASCRIPT FUNDAMENTALS

[VO]

3. So if React is really mostly just javascript - guess what? You will be a much better React developer if you make sure you know javascript! Or, if I make sure you know javascript.

And of course, the other great thing about getting good with javascript is, you can apply to all of the many other frameworks out there. Your javascript skills are transferable to other libraries like Svelte or Vue or Angular, right now, and of course, all of the other libraries that are sure to come along in the future. If you want to be a web developer, learning javascript is absolutely positively the most important thing to learn and learn well.

And if you're already super great at javascript, then great, hopefully these videos will be a useful review, or maybe even further your javascript knowledge a little.

WHAT WE'LL REVIEW

[VO]
Before we get started, I'm going to take just a minute to talk about the core javascript fundamentals that we'll focus on here.

[SC]
the DOM
[VO]
First of all, we'll learn about the DOM. React uses the DOM to work it's magic, so we better know what that is and how to use it.

[SC]
FUNCTIONAL JAVASCRIPT
[VO]

Second and perhaps most importantly, we'll introduce you to functional javascript.
