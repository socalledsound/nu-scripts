## w1 v3 CORE JS - reviewing DOM manipulation -- 7.5 mins?

[SC]
hi there web page
[VO]
Welcome back. In this first series of videos, we're going to we're going to make the page you see here. It's just a list of names, and of course we could write this in html pretty trivially, and it would look the same.

[SC]

[VO]

But we're going to do it with javascript, and we're going to write it in a way that is as close as possible to what a React app looks like.

That way, we can review the javascript fundamentals that are so key to feeling comfortable as a React developer and simultaneously get a taste of what React looks like. Sort of. Kind of.

[SC]

1. Introduce you to how a react app is structured

[VO]
This videos will introduce you to how React apps are structured, so that when it's time to actually write some React code, it won't be entirely new to you.

[SC]

    2. REACT IS (mostly) JUST JAVASCRIPT

[VO]

Second, they will show you something that I think is SUPER helpful to remember when you're writing React apps, which is that, for the most part, React apps are just javascript. It might not be the javascript that you're used to writing, because this is javascript at a high level.

But if you can learn and remember the ways in which React is just javascript, I think you'll be a much more capable and confident React developer. The goal is to make sure that you know all the javascript you need to know.

[SC]

3. JAVASCRIPT FUNDAMENTALS

[VO]

So if React is mostly just javascript - guess what? You will be a much better React developer if you make sure you know javascript! Or, if I make sure you know javascript.

[SC]

    THE DOM
    FUNCTIONS AND FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING IN JAVASCRIPT
    ARRAY METHODS
    OBJECTS AND OBJECT DESTRUCTURING
    TEMPLATE LITERALS
    IMPORT/EXPORT

[VO]
So what are we going to learn or review in these videos?

[SC]
the DOM
[VO]
First of all, the DOM. React uses the DOM to work it's magic, so let's make sure we know what it is and how javascript uses it.

[SC]
FUNCTIONAL JAVASCRIPT
[VO]

Second and perhaps most importantly, having a strong foundation with functional javascript is essential to writing good react code.

So we'll review functions and how to compose with them and learn about side effects, higher order functions and immutability, all terms that you will come upon constantly as you advance your knwoledge of React.

This will by no means be an exhaustive introduction to functional programming -- ou could spend years mastering functional javascript. But we'll introducec you to the key concepts that are essential to understanding React.

[SC]
last slide

[VO]
If these things look like things you already know -- that's great! You're probably more than ready to start coding in React. But I recommend you go through these videos anyway, they're all pretty short and, as I said before, I think learning how to react without react is actually a great way to get started with React.
