react = mapping data into react elements

[SC]

    const doSomethingXTimes = (x, func) => {
        for(let i = 0; i < x; i++){
            func()
        }
    }

    const sayHi = () => {
        console.log('hi')
    }

    const beAmazed = () => {
        console.log('ðŸ˜²')
    }

    doSomethingXTimes(3, sayHi) // logs hi to the console three times
    doSomethingXTimes(3, beAmazed) // logs hi to the console three times

And, functions can be the input parameters of another function! In other words, functions can be used inside other functions -- and we can pass them in just as we would a variable. So, here, we can write a function that executes any function that we pass in to it, three times.

The function that we pass in here is called a callback function, you have probably already seen them?

element.addEventListener("click", () => { console.log("Hello World!")});

For instance, when we create an eventListener in javascript, we pass in a callback function, which is used in the function that we pass it in to, when the specified event is triggered.

And, remember how functions can be passed in as parameters? Well guess what? They can also be returned from other functions!

A function which either has a function as one of its arguments or returns a function is called a higher order function. They

This capability of functions allows us to use them in lots of interesting ways.

Again, notice how I can compose with functions, making

const addOne = (num) => num + 1

const myNumber = 10
const newNumber = addOne(myNumber) // 11

[VO]
At the other extreme, look at this javascript code. We have, first of all a function. It's a pure function and it's a pretty simple function: addOne. It takes in a number and adds one to it.
Now, I should say -- a benefit of imperative code is, it's very easy to see what's going on here, right?

[SC]

const addOne = (num) => num + 1

const numbers = [1,6,3,7]
const newNumbers = []

for(let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++){
newNumbers[i] = addOne(numbers[i])
}

console.log(numbers)
console.log(newNumbers)

[VO]
And if I want to add one to every item in an array of numbers, and make a new array with the new numbers? I can use a for loop.

This is an imperative approach. It's very explicit and easy to read. But...for loops are also the biggest single source of errors in all of computer programming!

[SC]

const numbers = [1,6,3,7]
const newNumbers = numbers.map((num) => num + 1)
[VO]
And, at least in javascript -- thanks to it's support for higher order functions -- there's a better way.
