Welcome back.

In the last video we explored functions in javascript, and if you recall I mentioned that functions in javascript are what we call 'first class citizens'.  Which means that functions can be assigned to variables, be passed into other functions like any other parameter, and also be returned from other functions.

We've already seen a 

As we've seen, these capabilities of functions allow us to compose more elaborate structures from other functions.

These capabilities are super useful for structuring code.  

We've already seen a few fairly simple examples of 



Functions help us structure programs and reduce repetition and they also give us a way to usefully name blocks of code. 

So, if we think about a program or a piece of software as a process, functions are ways to take a process and break it into discrete parts.

If we want to put together a meal, for instance, there are actually a lot of different things that we need to do.  

We probably need to chop up some garlic and onions and sautee them, and we'll probably also need to cut up some veggies or maybe some chicken to throw in that pan.

And I hope you can see where I'm going with that, this process of cutting stuff up is already being applied in several different contexts, so it's probably a good idea to think about writing a function that involves knives.  

And as you've already seen, we'll probably be able to write this knife weilding function in such a way that it can be flexibly transformed to suit the finely minced garlic that we'll want and also the more robust slices of say red pepper that we'll be adding to this meal.






And if you recall I mentioned that functions in javascript are first class citizens.  This means that functions can be assigned to variables, be passed into other functions like any other parameter, and also be returned from other functions.

And it also means that javascript is very capable as a functional programming language, because functional programming is a style of programming in which we compose software using....functions.

In functional programming, the goal is to compose software using functions.  



write small and specific functions which can be combined to create larger functions.  There's no hierarchical structure, as you sometimes find in class-based approaches, but instead just...functions

In React,  we use functions -- which we call components -- to create and update small and specific user interface elements, like a button or a list item, which we call components, and then we combine those components -- which are functions -- together to build a web page or an app.
