#### video 4 composing with functions -- 7.5 mins?

        arrow functions are cool
        functions should do one thing
        functions can have parameters, and default parameters too
        functions have a single return value; if we want to return more than one thing
            we can use an object or an array
        there's actually a lot more to learn about functions in JS, but we'll come back to it
        react components are always functions that return a single DOM element, eg a div
        this render function is a lot like something you're about to see in React,
            except that in React we get that notion of a virtual DOM, which we'll talk about soon.
