Hello, everyone! And welcome.

In this course, you will be learning to use the React front-end library for building web applications with javascript.

[SC]

[VO]
We'll build a large, professional-grade application that will challenge your skills and introduce you to many of the most useful tools and techniques in the React ecosystem.

REACTSTRAP

We'll use reactstrap -- bootstrap for React -- for our styling

HOOKS
[VO]
You'll learn react Hooks

React Router

And along the way, you'll learn a lot about javascript.

Did I just say javascript? Wait let me say that again. Javascript. JAVASCRIPT!

React === javascript
[VO]
Learning React means learning to write javascript at a high level!
I know that you've already learned a little javascript, maybe even a lot.
When I myself started learning React, I thought I was pretty good at javascript.
But let me tell you, the things I learned about javascript from learning React and Redux just absolutely blew my mind, because React leans very heavily on the declarative and functional style of javascript. To write it well you'll need to be well-versed in this style.

[SC]

[VO]
So this course will begin with a brief introduction to functional programming in javascript.

We're calling it 'React Without React', because what will build in the first section of the course won't use React but, honestly, it will look a lot like React code, if you squint. Hopefully it will be a great way to ground you in the fundamentals of javascript that you need to thrive as a React developer and

Honestly, I really love React, I think it's a really fun way to build web sites. And I hope that by the end of this course, you'll feel the same way, and will be super jazzed to create your own projects with React.

And in that spirit, I want to start this course with an enthusiastic reminder that this is YOUR course.

Or, it can be. And it should be.

You're going to learn a lot in this course and it's going to be challenging but the biggest challenge of all is the challenge you need to present to yourself, to take the skills you learn here and build stuff!

Be sure to make it yours! The best part about Nucamp isn't the videos and it isn't the exercises.
Wherever possible, this course will give you exercises and challenges

, along with which means you will be writing a lot of JavaScript.

There's a big difference between learning how to write React and learning how to write react well.
IN this course, you'll learn both! And, hopefully, have fun doing it!
We're going to build a big, challenging project as well as several smaller projects.

As we go, you should try to always build your own versions
of what we're doing, with small modificaitons, make this material your own.

welcome to the course, i think i'll write this last.

WELCOME TO REACT WEEK 1
Welcome back everyone! In this course, you will be learning to use the React.js front-end library, which means you will be writing a lot of JavaScript. This first week, you will focus on learning more JavaScript in order to prepare you to learn React.

Slides/Screenshots:
You will be learning about JavaScript objects, classes, advanced array methods, and more.

And you will spend a lot of this week in hands-on practice of those concepts, through multiple Code Challenges and a Quiz. At the end of this week, and every week, you will meet with your instructor and classmates to review what you have learned and work on a Workshop Assignment.

After that, your next four weeks will be spent learning React. In Week 2, expect to learn how to set up a React project and begin writing your first React components. You will work with the same “Nucamp” campsite review website you built in Bootstrap, but you will start from the ground up and build the same website using React.
In Week 3, you will learn about different types of React components, and about the React Router library to help you turn your React project into what’s called a Single Page Application, or SPA.

In Week 4, you will work with user input via forms, and you’ll learn about a state management library called Redux.

In Week 5, you will get even deeper into Redux, and you’ll learn about using the Fetch API and JavaScript promises to request data from a web server.

In addition to all this, starting in Week 2, you will take your Portfolio Project from your Bootstrap course and recreate it using React.

Expect to learn a lot during this course, and remember as always to stay focused, …, and don’t forget the 20 minute rule!
