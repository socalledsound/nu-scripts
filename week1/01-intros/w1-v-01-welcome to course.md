# hello, and the outline of the course

[SC]

[VO]
Hello, everyone! And welcome.

In this course, you will be learning to use the React front-end library for building web applications with javascript.

[SC]

[VO]
We'll build a large, professional-grade application that will challenge your skills and introduce you to many of the most useful tools and techniques in the React ecosystem.

[SC]
REACTSTRAP
[VO]
We'll use reactstrap -- bootstrap for React -- for our styling.

[SC]
REACT SPRING
[VO]
And React Spring for animations.

[SC]
React Router DOM
[VO]
We'll use React Router for site navigation

[SC]
Formik
[VO]
And Formik to handle forms.

[SC]
HOOKS
[VO]
You'll learn React Hooks for component level logic

[SC]
REDUX
REDUX TOOLKIT
[VO]
And Redux and redux toolkit for global state.

[VO]
And along the way, you'll learn a lot about javascript.

Did I just say javascript? Wait let me say that again. Javascript. JAVASCRIPT!

[SC]
React === javascript
[VO]
Learning React means learning to write javascript at a high level!

I know that you've already learned a little javascript and some of you may have even learned a lot of javascript. Your javascript knowledge will serve you well with React.

When I myself started learning React, I actually thought I was pretty good at javascript, and people had been paying me to be pretty good at javascript for quite a few years.

But let me tell you, the things I learned about javascript from learning React and Redux just absolutely blew my mind, because React leans very heavily on the declarative and functional style of javascript. To write it well you'll need to be well-versed in this style of javascript.

[SC]

[VO]
So this course will begin with a brief introduction to functional programming in javascript, where you'll learn about pure functions, higher order functions, closures and not mutating data and everything else that you absolutely need to know about declarative javascript before you tackle React.

We're calling it 'React Without React', because what we'll build in the first section of the course won't use React but, honestly, it will look a lot like React code, if you squint. Our hope is that it will be a great way to ground you in the fundamentals of javascript that you need to thrive as a React developer and will also prepare you for React by helping you understand how it does its magic.

And throughout the course, you'll also build several smaller projects.

Small projects are great, because they allow us to practice specific skills, give us practice taking a React project from nothing to something and, hopefully, will give you the experience that you need to feel confident getting started with your own projects, because at the end of the day, those personal projects are what will define your success as a React developer!

Honestly, I really love React, I think it's a really fun way to build web sites. And I hope that by the end of this course, you'll feel the same way.

You're going to learn a lot in this course and it's going to be challenging but the biggest challenge of all is the challenge you need to present to yourself, to take the skills you learn here and build stuff!

So remember: always be working on your portfolio project or projects, even if you don't feel that you have the skills to do it -- you'll GET the skills by doing the work.

And, as always, remember the 20 minute rule. Reach out for help, either to your instructor, or in the React slack channel. And remember to share your work with your peers! Let's inspire each other to become great React developers!

In the next video, we'll begin by looking at some of the benefits that React brings to the table. I'll see you there.

There's a big difference between learning how to write React and learning how to write react well.
IN this course, you'll learn both! And, hopefully, have fun doing it!
We're going to build a big, challenging project as well as several smaller projects.

As we go, you should try to always build your own versions
of what we're doing, with small modificaitons, make this material your own.

# OLD SCRIPT:

(largely not applicable any more)
WELCOME TO REACT WEEK 1
Welcome back everyone! In this course, you will be learning to use the React.js front-end library, which means you will be writing a lot of JavaScript. This first week, you will focus on learning more JavaScript in order to prepare you to learn React.

Slides/Screenshots:
You will be learning about JavaScript objects, classes, advanced array methods, and more.

And you will spend a lot of this week in hands-on practice of those concepts, through multiple Code Challenges and a Quiz. At the end of this week, and every week, you will meet with your instructor and classmates to review what you have learned and work on a Workshop Assignment.

After that, your next four weeks will be spent learning React. In Week 2, expect to learn how to set up a React project and begin writing your first React components. You will work with the same “Nucamp” campsite review website you built in Bootstrap, but you will start from the ground up and build the same website using React.
In Week 3, you will learn about different types of React components, and about the React Router library to help you turn your React project into what’s called a Single Page Application, or SPA.

In Week 4, you will work with user input via forms, and you’ll learn about a state management library called Redux.

In Week 5, you will get even deeper into Redux, and you’ll learn about using the Fetch API and JavaScript promises to request data from a web server.

In addition to all this, starting in Week 2, you will take your Portfolio Project from your Bootstrap course and recreate it using React.

Expect to learn a lot during this course, and remember as always to stay focused, …, and don’t forget the 20 minute rule!
