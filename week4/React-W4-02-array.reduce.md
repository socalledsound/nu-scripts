array.map transforms an array into a new array

arr => new array

##### VO

Previously in this course, you've learned a few very powerful array methods.  

You've learned how to use Array.map(), which you can use to trasform an array into a new array, by passing in a callback function that specifies how you want to transform each element in the array.

And you've learned how to use Array.filter, which you can use to create a new array

These array methods, Array.map and Array.filter, and their related Array methods, Array.forEach and Array.find, are the foot soldiers of Array methods.  You use them every day because they're simple and cheap and they get very specific things done. 

And in their own way, they're graceful and elegant and, you know, good enough.

But in this video, you will meet the big boss of array methods: Array.reduce.

And just like Array.map and Array.filter, Array.reduce takes in a function and it does some stuff with it.  What does it do?  DUH.  It reduces.  And so this function is called a reducer function.

And guess what?  Reducer functions are the heart and soul of the big thing that you'll learn about this week, the most dreaded and feared and loved word in the React eco system : Redux.

Redux = Reducer + Flux.
