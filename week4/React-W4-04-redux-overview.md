SO now you've learned about MVC -- which stands for model-view controller -- which is a very popular way of structuring programs.  The strength of an MVC approach is that it enforces a seperation of concerns.   When we use MVC to structure our app, we strive keep the model -- or data -- seperate from the view layer -- or user interface.  And we keep both of those layers seperate from a Controller, which handles the logic of our application.  IN an MVC application, the Controller recieves input from the View, updates the model based on that input, and then updates the view with the new data.  In other words, it has a bidirectional flow of data.

And, while the seperation of concerns present in the MVC model is a tremendous step in the right direction, the bidirectional flow of data can be problematic, particularly in a web application, where the state of a user interface is complicated by the complex interactions of asynch

Flux
    data flows in a single direction
    store holds application state and also the logic to update
    dispatcher
    action

Next you learned about the FLUX model, which was an effort to deal with some of these problems.  In the FLUX model, data flows in a single direction.  And the state


about the flux model, which is a functional approach to structuring the logic of an application.   Where we dispatch an action to the store
