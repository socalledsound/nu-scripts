#### video 2 -A using github with this course -- 5 mins honestly

## actualy, if we're using moodle we don't need this

#### FROM OUTLINE:

    why is github awesome?
    but what the heck is git?
    (CODE CHALLENGE HERE??? deleting and bringing back node modules folder?)
    (CODE CHALLENGE ON GIT AND BRANCHES??)
    GIT/GITHUB/BRANCHES/HOW TO USE THESE REPOS
    before we CRA, they download the github repo for the hearts and install it that way,
    run it and see it in action, then ask them to delete it and say that we'll build it from scratch,
    but they can refer to it if they get lost or confused.
    (should we also give them the code for the nucamp site somewhere?  this is a big question in my mind
    that I truly don't know the answer too, after 20 years of teaching -- is it better to trust them or not???)
